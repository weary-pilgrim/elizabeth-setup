## Install iTerm2

This is a TerminalÂ replacement.

- [Download it](https://iterm2.com/) and install it
- Never open the built-in Terminal program again. It stinks
- Skim the highlights section and the general section in the docs. (You might want to look at them again later after you have used it for a while)

You now have a new Mac app called `iTerm`. To run it, enter &#8984;+Space and then type `iTerm`.

## Install HomeBrew

This is a package manager for Mac command line programs. It knows how to install command line programs (like Python).

- Open a new `iterm` window
- Copy the command they have on their [homepage](https://brew.sh/)

 - Paste it into your `iterm` window (and hit Enter)
 - Accept the default answer at any prompts
 - Follow any instructions the script gives you
 - Close your `iterm` window (you have to do this to make sure the Unix shell running in the terminal knows about new stuff)

You now have a new command-line program called `brew`.
